Hi, I’m Bjorn, I’m from the Netherlands. I’ve been working Angular, RxJS and TypeScript for about three and a half years. During this time, I’ve seen and experienced what TypeScript can do and I would love to share my experiences and learn from yours too!

On a daily basis, I work for different clients using the aforementioned stack. I also give training in Angular, RxJS and TypeScript or a combination of the three and am easily excited by new cool ideas.
